<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This study explores the use of Wikidata and Wikipedia as viable sources for flood data analysis. We evaluate the reliability and scope of these platforms despite inherent challenges such as geographical biases and inconsistencies in data. Our findings indicate that Wikidata and Wikipedia are particularly valuable for providing not only detailed textual descriptions and social context but also insights into the public’s interest and engagement with flood events. By juxtaposing this dataset with an established flood database, we investigate the conditions and extent to which flood-related pages are generated on these platforms. Our analysis reveals that the creation, content, and diffusion of Wikidata and Wikipedia entries are influenced by factors including geographical location, social context, and event’s severity. This underscores the potential of these platforms as complementary tools in disaster management and research, offering a unique perspective.</p>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The study compares flood events-related entries on Wikidata and Wikipedia with a traditional flood database, examining the factors that influence the creation and detail of these entries.</li>
<li>Wikidata and Wikipedia offer credible and extensive information about floods, despite challenges in data consistency and geographical representation.</li>
<li>These platforms provide valuable context and measure public interest in flood events, offering a complementary perspective to better understand their stakes and possibly enhancing the richness of traditional data sources</li>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A flood is a natural disaster characterized by the overflow of water onto normally dry land, which can result from various factors, including heavy rainfall, snowmelt, storm surges, or the failure of dams or levees. It can occur gradually over an extended period or suddenly, and might cause damage to humans, infrastructure and ecosystems with varying degrees of severity, ranging from minor flooding to catastrophic events causing widespread destruction and deathtoll. Understanding the dynamics of floods globally, including their causes, patterns, and impacts, is essential for effective anticipation, mitigation, and response to minimize their effects on communities and enhance resilience to these events <span class="citation" data-cites="doocy_human_2013">(<a href="#ref-doocy_human_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Doocy et al. 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Indeed, by studying floods occurring in a large number of contexts, researchers are more likely to identify patterns and understand underlying causes such as climate change and land-use practices, and develop efficient strategies for governments, policymakers, urban planners, and disaster management agencies. Furthermore, understanding global flood dynamics can facilitate international collaboration and resource allocation, fostering a collective response to mitigate their consequences.</p>
<p>This is one of the rationale behind the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) <span class="citation" data-cites="brakenridge_global_nodate">(<a href="#ref-brakenridge_global_nodate" role="doc-biblioref">Brakenridge n.d.</a>)</span>, which provides a global database of flood events. Combining remote sensing and news reports’ analysis, it produces detailed information on the extent, frequency, and impacts of floods worldwide from 1985 <span class="citation" data-cites="kundzewicz_large_2013">(<a href="#ref-kundzewicz_large_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Kundzewicz, Pińskwar, and Brakenridge 2013</a>)</span> to this day. It constitutes an invaluable source of information on the subject, used in many scientific studies on flood events <span class="citation" data-cites="doocy_human_2013 hu_flood-induced_2018 najibi_recent_2018 tellman_satellite_2021">Winsemius et al. (<a href="#ref-winsemius_framework_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Events detected through remote sensing are recorded when experts assess they are significant enough in terms of damage or occurrence frequency (based on news or institutional sources) <span class="citation" data-cites="doocy_human_2013">(<a href="#ref-doocy_human_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Doocy et al. 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Producing a global flood event dataset poses numerous challenges due to the complex nature of data semantics, collection, standardization, and accessibility. A primary obstacle is the lack of uniform reporting standards leading to inconsistencies in definitions of flood events and in data collection methods. Varying technological capabilities (material access and practice’s acculturation) across geographical regions of the world also contribute to disparities in data availability. Disasters like floods might occur in areas where communication and infrastructure are limited, and/or not used for real-time data collection. Political, social, and economic factors also play a role, as some regions may under-report or document flood occurrences differently, due to reasons such as insufficient or different resources and infrastructures. Additionally, there are inequalities in the geographies of data production that reflect and reproduce global economic core-peripheries <span class="citation" data-cites="graham_inequitable_2014 graham_towards_2015 haklay_why_2016">(<a href="#ref-graham_inequitable_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Graham 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-graham_towards_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Graham, De Sabbata, and Zook 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-haklay_why_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Haklay 2016</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="ash_digital_2018">(<a href="#ref-ash_digital_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ash, Kitchin, and Leszczynski 2018</a>)</span> refers to some “informational magnetism” resulting in the over-representation of the global North (the “core”). As a result, and despite advancements in satellite technology and remote sensing, ensuring comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date global flood data remains difficult. Overcoming this challenge requires better data curation, global efforts to improve information-sharing mechanisms, and the development of a critical eye on the reasons for data production, both in terms of contexts and uses.</p>
<section id="participatory-approaches" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participatory-approaches">Participatory approaches</h2>
<p>Participatory data collection can significantly enhance the understanding and management of flood events. This approach involves engaging local communities, citizens, and grassroots organizations in the collection, analysis, and sharing of data related to flood occurrences. Examples of such initiatives show the potential of participatory data to complement institutional data about floods at a local scale <span class="citation" data-cites="dixon_role_2021 sekajugo_can_2022">(<a href="#ref-dixon_role_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Dixon, Johns, and Fernandez 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-sekajugo_can_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Sekajugo et al. 2022</a>)</span>. By incorporating local knowledge, experiences, and observations, participatory methods complement traditional data sources, offering valuable insights into flood-prone areas that might be overlooked by centralized or remote monitoring systems, controlled by certain systems in power (Nation-states, heterogeneous coalition of technologically savvy individuals, private technology companies). More broadly, volunteered geographical data at a local scale has been shown to be a valuable source of data regarding hazards <span class="citation" data-cites="herfort_evolution_2021">(<a href="#ref-herfort_evolution_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Herfort et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Communities living in flood-prone regions possess unique, context-specific, even vernacular knowledge about local environmental changes, historical flood memory, vulnerable areas, and coping mechanisms. Engaging these communities in data collection through citizen science initiatives, mobile applications, community mapping, or participatory workshops allows for the collection of granular, real-time information that supplements existing datasets. Ideally, this bottom-up approach not only enhances the accuracy and granularity of flood data, but also fosters community empowerment in terms of resilience, by engaging all communities to participate, including those excluded from decision-making or digital access.</p>
<p>Moreover, participatory data can bridge gaps in official reporting by capturing small-scale or localized flood events that are not publicized and thus recognized by institutions. Integrating participatory data with conventional datasets enables a more comprehensive understanding of flood dynamics, aiding in the development of anticipation policies effective early warning systems, and disaster response plans.</p>

<section id="wikidata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wikidata">Wikidata</h2>
<p>In parallel to research-related, expert database such as the DFO dataset on the subject, the Wikimedia project stands as a remarkable source of structured or semi-structured participatory data with its vast array of user-generated content across platforms like Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons. Wikipedia, as one of the largest collaborative encyclopedias, and one of the most used and visited websites globally <span class="citation" data-cites="graham_towards_2015 ballatore_digital_2017">(<a href="#ref-graham_towards_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Graham, De Sabbata, and Zook 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-ballatore_digital_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Ballatore, Graham, and Sen 2017</a>)</span> harnesses the collective knowledge of volunteers worldwide who contribute, edit, and curate articles on diverse subjects, including geographical features, history, and environmental events such as floods. It can be viewed both as a source of breaking news and as an encyclopedia, providing information and narrative regarding ongoing and past events, in particular crises and controversies <span class="citation" data-cites="moats_following_2019">(<a href="#ref-moats_following_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Moats 2019</a>)</span>. Wikidata, an open database, provides structured data that can be used to categorize and link information, potentially cataloging flood events, affected regions, and relevant details. Wikimedia Commons serves as a repository for multimedia files, housing images, maps, and other visual resources related to floods, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of such events. The open nature of Wikimedia projects allows for continual updates and contributions, making it a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the public seeking information on various topics, including flood events, across the globe. The Wikimedia projects are an example of user-generated content on web 2.0 <span class="citation" data-cites="mandiberg_4_2020">(<a href="#ref-mandiberg_4_2020" role="doc-biblioref">O’Reilly 2020</a>)</span>. Moreover, flood events are generally associated with a location or toponymic information: as such, the produced data can also be included in what <span class="citation" data-cites="goodchild_citizens_2007">Goodchild (<a href="#ref-goodchild_citizens_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> calls “volunteered geographic information” (VGI).</p>
<p>Wikipedia articles have been studied in the context of managing crises due to its accessibility, comprehensiveness, and real-time updates, either focusing on content creation or consultation. This has been the case for e.g.&nbsp;epidemiologic crises <span class="citation" data-cites="van_velsen_should_2012 colavizza_covid-19_2020">(<a href="#ref-van_velsen_should_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Van Velsen et al. 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-colavizza_covid-19_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Colavizza 2020</a>)</span>, natural disasters, technological accidents and violent conflict <span class="citation" data-cites="keegan_hot_2013">(<a href="#ref-keegan_hot_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Keegan, Gergle, and Contractor 2013</a>)</span>. During flood events, people might seek immediate information regarding safety measures, evacuation procedures, flood-prone areas, and emergency contacts. Wikipedia’s open editing structure allows for rapid dissemination of accurate information, enabling users to access critical details swiftly. Moreover, the collaborative nature of Wikipedia ensures that a vast array of perspectives and expertise contribute to its articles, resulting in comprehensive coverage of flood-related topics, including flood mitigation strategies, historical flood data, and relevant government responses. This breadth of information empowers individuals, communities, and organizations to make informed decisions and take effective action in response to floods, ultimately aiding in crisis management and mitigation efforts. Additionally, Wikipedia’s multilingual support ensures that its resources are accessible to a global audience, facilitating disaster response efforts in diverse regions affected by floods.</p>
<p>Like many volunteered mapping platforms, the Wikimedia projects are receiving growing interest from the research community <span class="citation" data-cites="farda-sarbas_wikidata_2019">(<a href="#ref-farda-sarbas_wikidata_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Farda-Sarbas and Müller-Birn 2019</a>)</span>. As such, they are used in various projects: on the one hand, the content is employed directly as a data source, e.g.&nbsp;in history, literacy studies, archeology, philosophy <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao_systematic_2023">(<a href="#ref-zhao_systematic_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Zhao 2023</a>)</span>, linguistics <span class="citation" data-cites="turki_using_2017">(<a href="#ref-turki_using_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Turki et al. 2017</a>)</span>, medical and biological sciences <span class="citation" data-cites="farda-sarbas_wikidata_2019 burgstaller-muehlbacher_wikidata_2016">(<a href="#ref-farda-sarbas_wikidata_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Farda-Sarbas and Müller-Birn 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-burgstaller-muehlbacher_wikidata_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Burgstaller-Muehlbacher et al. 2016</a>)</span>, etc. or as an indicator of public interest <span class="citation" data-cites="mittermeier_using_2021">(<a href="#ref-mittermeier_using_2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mittermeier et al. 2021</a>)</span>. On the other hand, studies consider the Wikimedia projects as a research object, e.g.&nbsp;analyzing the contributors’ motivations <span class="citation" data-cites="antin_my_2011">(<a href="#ref-antin_my_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Antin 2011</a>)</span>, comparing their data to traditional databases <span class="citation" data-cites="lorini_uneven_2020">(<a href="#ref-lorini_uneven_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lorini et al. 2020</a>)</span>, evaluating completeness <span class="citation" data-cites="royal_whats_2009">(<a href="#ref-royal_whats_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Royal and Kapila 2009</a>)</span>, accuracy <span class="citation" data-cites="giles_internet_2005">(<a href="#ref-giles_internet_2005" role="doc-biblioref">Giles 2005</a>)</span>, topic coverage <span class="citation" data-cites="halavais_analysis_2008">(<a href="#ref-halavais_analysis_2008" role="doc-biblioref">Halavais and Lackaff 2008</a>)</span>, local <span class="citation" data-cites="ballatore_digital_2017 ballatore_angeles_2020">(<a href="#ref-ballatore_digital_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Ballatore, Graham, and Sen 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-ballatore_angeles_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ballatore and De Sabbata 2020</a>)</span> and global distribution <span class="citation" data-cites="graham_towards_2015 kollektiv_orangotango_uneven_2018">(<a href="#ref-graham_towards_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Graham, De Sabbata, and Zook 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-kollektiv_orangotango_uneven_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Graham et al. 2018</a>)</span>, analyzing knowledge construction <span class="citation" data-cites="oeberst_knowledge_2014">(<a href="#ref-oeberst_knowledge_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Oeberst et al. 2014</a>)</span> and social network dynamics <span class="citation" data-cites="iba_analyzing_2010">(<a href="#ref-iba_analyzing_2010" role="doc-biblioref">Iba et al. 2010</a>)</span>, etc. However, using a worldwide, crowdsourced, open database implies characterizing its contributors. Firstly, studies show that user-generated content is unequally distributed on a global scale: it is generally skewed towards countries from the Global North, whether it be in terms of participation, representation or access <span class="citation" data-cites="kollektiv_orangotango_uneven_2018 graham_towards_2015 ballatore_digital_2017">(<a href="#ref-kollektiv_orangotango_uneven_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Graham et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-graham_towards_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Graham, De Sabbata, and Zook 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-ballatore_digital_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Ballatore, Graham, and Sen 2017</a>)</span>. Research conducted on Wikipedia suggests that the platform follows the same pattern. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="graham_inequitable_2014">Graham (<a href="#ref-graham_inequitable_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> shows that Europe and North America get the greatest number of articles per person. Secondly, participation tends to be skewed towards “a more wealthy, more educated, more Western, more white and more male demographic” <span class="citation" data-cites="crampton_beyond_2013">(<a href="#ref-crampton_beyond_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Crampton et al. 2013, 132</a>)</span>. For example, research on OpenStreetMap – an open and crowdsourced mapping platform – suggests that it reproduces the socio-economical structures <span class="citation" data-cites="bittner_diversity_2017">(<a href="#ref-bittner_diversity_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Bittner 2017</a>)</span>. The risk is that these crowdsourced platforms reproduce the inequalities, leaving economically and socially deprived areas also digitally deprived <span class="citation" data-cites="jokar_arsanjani_impact_2015">(<a href="#ref-jokar_arsanjani_impact_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Mashhadi, Quattrone, and Capra 2015</a>)</span>. There is also a strong gender asymmetry on the web, contributing to biased data <span class="citation" data-cites="stephens_gender_2013 gardner_quantifying_2020">(<a href="#ref-stephens_gender_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Stephens 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-gardner_quantifying_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Gardner et al. 2020</a>)</span>.<br>
Identifying the data distribution is capital for interpretation and analysis, given that the Wikimedia projects are user-generated and are therefore subjects to biases. The question “who produces the data?” must then be addressed. <span class="citation" data-cites="lorini_uneven_2020">Lorini et al. (<a href="#ref-lorini_uneven_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> studied the report of floods on Wikipedia. However, to our knowledge, no study using multiple Wikimedia projects and analyzing the data distribution and production in time as well as in space, using quantitative and textometric methods, has been conducted on this subject.</p>
<p>However, challenges such as ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and standardization persist in participatory approaches. While establishing protocols for data validation and quality control between participatory and formal datasets is important to maximize the potential of participatory data and to maintain data integrity <span class="citation" data-cites="senaratne_review_2017">(<a href="#ref-senaratne_review_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Senaratne et al. 2017</a>)</span>, the participatory data can be standardized. In other words, the subtleties perceived by local communities can be smoothed out (i) in interfaces designed by situated engineers and (ii) in data collection via protocols designed by situated scientists. However, the stakes around data validation and homogenization are particularly high in the prospect of studying floods at a global scale.</p>
<p>Overall, leveraging participatory data in conjunction with conventional methods can enrich global flood databases, improve resilience, and empower communities to better respond to and mitigate the impacts of flood events. This collaborative approach can contribute significantly to more holistic and inclusive strategies for managing floods worldwide, to question (i) the data (how, by whom and for what purpose they are collected) and (ii) the collection process (highlighting ethnocentric biases by comparison).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="primary-census-of-flood-events">Primary census of flood events</h2>
<p>We collected Wikidata about floods, using the glitter R package (an API-client to the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint API) <span class="citation" data-cites="vaudor_glitter_2023">(<a href="#ref-vaudor_glitter_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Vaudor and Salmon 2023</a>)</span>. Wikidata is a free and collaborative knowledge base, structured as a graph of interconnected items representing physical entities, events, concepts or topics, associated to a unique identifier. These items are linked through properties forming statements describing the relationships between items and/or attributes. Each query we run on Wikidata can hence be viewed as a graph query, where we retrieve items and attributes and the relationships between them.</p>
<div id="fig-queries" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;1: Wikidata queries represented as graphs.

</figure>
</div>
<p>We carried out a first Wikidata query (<a href="#fig-queries">Figure&nbsp;1</a> .a) to get all instances of floods or subclasses of floods as well as a few descriptors of these. The events can be located through <code>coords</code> (geographical coordinates) <code>loc</code> (a location -which can be any type of geographical item documented in Wikidata, e.g.&nbsp;a city, region or country- which in turn might provide coordinates-), or simply through the <code>country</code> variable -which might also in turn provide coordinates-). We used all these variables to try and provide coordinates for as many events as possible, with the greatest precision possible: we prioritized <code>coords</code> (when available) over coordinates corresponding to location, and coordinates corresponding to location (when available) to coordinates corresponding to country.</p>
<p>We carried out a second Wikidata query (<a href="#fig-queries">Figure&nbsp;1</a> .b) for each flood listed by this first query, to gather information about its time of occurrence (wdt:P585), start time (wdt:P580) and end time (wdt:P582). We hence tried to provide a date for each of the events using either one of the previous items, prioritizing the date provided by time of occurrence (if available) over the average date between start time and end time (if both were available), average date between start time and end time over start time or end time (if only one was available), and start time or end time over four-digit words in the events’ label if present (as labels generally consist of a mention of type of event, time and place). Time-related information on Wikidata are specified with varying precision, which when regarding floods generally vary between dayly precision and yearly precision.</p>
<p>We carried out a third Wikidata query (<a href="#fig-queries">Figure&nbsp;1</a> .c) for each country listed by the first query, to gather information about their coordinates, the languages used by their population (either official or used languages), and Human Development Index (HDI).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison-to-the-dartmouth-flood-observatory-data">Comparison to the Dartmouth Flood Observatory data</h2>
<p>We wanted to confront the data about floods documented through Wikidata (WD) to the data gathered by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) <span class="citation" data-cites="brakenridge_global_nodate">(<a href="#ref-brakenridge_global_nodate" role="doc-biblioref">Brakenridge n.d.</a>)</span>. We downloaded the DFO dataset and curated it to make it more easily comparable to our WD dataset, especially regarding country labels. We then tried to match each event in WD to one event in DFO through the following algorithm</p>
<p>For each WD event <code>flood</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>calculate the time difference between DFO events and <code>flood</code></li>
<li>calculate the distance between DFO events and <code>flood</code></li>
<li>check for all DFO events whether the time difference to <code>flood</code> is less than 400 days and the distance to <code>flood</code> is less than 400 kms (condition 1)</li>
<li>check for all DFO events whether the time difference to <code>flood</code> is less than 400 days and country matches country registered for <code>flood</code> (condition 2)</li>
<li>filter all DFO events to only keep those verifying condition 1 or condition 2</li>
<li>if several DFO events verify those conditions, retain only the one corresponding to lowest time difference to <code>flood</code>, and consider that this is the DFO event that matches <code>flood</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The rather high threshold of 400 days has been chosen to account both for the possibly low precision -sometimes, yearly precision- in dates, and the fact that flood events can be quite long, leading to heterogeneities in the way the date of occurrence is defined and recorded. The also rather high threshold of 400 kms has been chosen to account for the fact that Wikidata events are not always precisely located. The flood event might indeed be located through a location corresponding to the region centroid, or even country centroid. Using as an alternative to the distance the country of occurrence recorded in both datasets aimed at alleviating this problem of events located with very low spatial precision.</p>

<p>We ran all statistical analyses and produced graphics with the R software <span class="citation" data-cites="R_base">(<a href="#ref-R_base" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>R_base?</strong></a>)</span>. When comparing distributions through categories (associating this comparison with boxplots) we tested the difference of each category’s median with the other categories’ median using the Wilcoxon test, a non-parametric test based on ranks, in order not to rely on a normal distribution hypothesis or on asymptotic conditions. When we had more than two categories to compare, we compared one category to all other categories, pooling them. We generally considered models with two levels, the response depending on two categorical variables X_1 and X_2. We tested the significance of the difference in median of each level of X_1 against all other levels of X_1, and for each level of X_1, the difference in median of each level of X_2 against all other levels of X_2. We displayed on the graphics the difference in median for each group associated with a code for the p-value: <code>.</code>:p&lt;0.1, <code>*</code>:p&lt;0.05, <code>**</code>:p&lt;0.01, <code>***</code>:p&lt;0.001.</p>

<p>We scraped the text (all the textual content in headers from level one (h1) to level 6 (h6) as well as paragraphs) from all listed Wikipedia pages, using the <code>rvest</code> R package <span class="citation" data-cites="wickham_rvest_2024">(<a href="#ref-wickham_rvest_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham 2024</a>)</span>.

<p>We used Reinert’s method <span class="citation" data-cites="reinert_alceste_1990">(<a href="#ref-reinert_alceste_1990" role="doc-biblioref">Reinert 1990</a>)</span> to classify segments of our corpus (consisting in successive parts of the Wikipedia articles, segmented in such a way that each contains 10 lemmatized, content words).

Each class is characterized as a collection of over-represented words, and we used them to label each class in a one-worded, synthetic way. We then used these labelled classes to examine the relationship between the flood characteristics and the topic contents of articles.</p>

<section id="random-forests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="random-forests">Random Forests</h2>
<p>To better understand the non-linear relationship between quantitative variables and a set of non-independent descriptors, we ran random forest regressions using the R package randomForestSRC <span class="citation" data-cites="ishwaran_fast_2023">(<a href="#ref-ishwaran_fast_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Ishwaran and Kogalur 2023</a>)</span>. Random forests work by constructing multiple decision trees from bootstrapped samples of the dataset and averaging their predictions to improve accuracy and control overfitting. Each tree is built using a random subset of predictors at each split, enhancing diversity among trees. Variable importance was calculated by assessing the increase in prediction error when the values of a predictor were permuted. Variables’ partial effect correspond to the impact of a single predictor on the response variable, keeping other variables fixed, to show how changes in the predictor influence the outcome. We used partial dependence plots to understand the relationship between predictors and the response.</p>
<p>In these random forests regression models we used the following descriptors : the event’s deathtoll (absolute number), year of occurrence, country’s Human Development Index (HDI), population (in millions) and population density (number of people per squared kilometer). Describing pages we use article length (number of characters, in the translated to English text), and locality (whether the article is written in a language local to the event’s location).</p>

<p>The initial query provided <strong>792 Wikidata flood events</strong>. In terms of spatial precision, most coordinates are inferred from either variable country or variable location (the major part of provided locations being countries too). The date of most events is documented either directly or through the label of the event. Most events’ dates are provided with day precision but an important proportion (about one third) is provided with only annual precision.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison-to-dfo-data">Comparison to DFO data</h3>
<p>We could expect the WD dataset to include less events than the DFO dataset which records flood events primarily based on physical criteria, while one can argue that events are only recorded in WD when they reach some level of social or historical significance. We also expected the WD dataset to be somewhat biased towards events in countries with a higher HDI, as crowdsourced web datasets are known to be. We hence compared the number of events in both datasets according to the HDI class of the country where the event took place.</p>
<p>We compare the number of events in both datasets (WD and DFO) according to the Human Development Index of the country where the event took place.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-comp_WD_DFO">Figure&nbsp;2</a> <em>a) Number of flood events documented in Wikidata (wd), DFO (dfo) or both datasets according to our matching algorithm. The number of events is displayed according to the Human Development Index (HDI) class of the country where the event took place (countries are pooled in the first, second, third or fourth quartile). b) Deathtoll per event according to HDI class and occurrence in one or both datasets. The estimate considered for deathtoll comes either from the DFO dataset, or by default from the Wikidata dataset (some events are not associated to any deathtoll estimate, in which case they are excluded from this figure). Some events happened in places where the country name changed through time making it difficult to link them to a HDI value: these are the ones represented by an unknown HDI class.</em></p>
<p><a href="#fig-comp_WD_DFO">Figure&nbsp;2</a> .a confirms that compared to DFO, the proportion of events in Wikidata corresponding to countries with higher HDI is important. On the other hand, the distribution of events in the DFO dataset through HDI categories implies most events occur in the first and especially second quartile for HDI. An unbiased distribution of events (when defined through purely physical criteria) should reflect the total flood-prone area in each of in the four quartiles for HDI. An unbiased distribution of “socially significant” events would reflect both the total flood-prone area in each of the four quartiles for HDI (which probably represent vary heterogeneous values) but also the geographical effect of human distribution. The DFO dataset primarily takes into account physical criteria to define a flood but still incorporates societal elements (regarding damage and deathtoll for instance) to account for the actual importance or significance of the event. Hence we can assume that the DFO distribution of events provides a relatively unbiased estimate of floods distribution, at least compared to the WD distribution. This highlights the systematic difficulty of defining, detecting and reporting flood events in an unbiased, homogeneous way across projects.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-comp_WD_DFO">Figure&nbsp;2</a> .b shows that compared to DFO-documented events, events included in the WD dataset are generally associated with higher deathtoll. For DFO-documented events, the lower the HDI class, the higher the deathtoll, which could be interpreted by impoverished countries having less resources and infrastructure to mitigate and respond to such disasters effectively, as well as more inadequate housing and settlement in vulnerable areas exacerbating the impact of floods on communities. As for WD-documented events, the few ones which occurred in lowest HDI countries also correspond to (very) high deathtolls indeed, but so do the ones which have occurred in the richest countries and even more so the ones for which we do not have a value for HDI. In this last case, the events documented in Wikidata only are often historical ones like the 1931 China floods (wd:Q1150973). These floods occurred in the Republic of China (1912-1949), for which we failed to obtain an HDI value, and which were associated with very high and somewhat discussed deathtolls. This highlights the fact that the WD dataset is biased towards events with high societal impact, which is not surprising given the nature of the project.</p>
<p>For some events we were able to find a match between the WD dataset and the DFO dataset, so that we could compare the deathtoll paired observations.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-deathtoll_WD_DFO">Figure&nbsp;3</a> shows that the deathtoll values are generally higher in the WD dataset than in the DFO dataset, which is consistent with the fact that the WD dataset is biased towards events with high societal impact. However, the correlation between the deathtoll values in the two datasets is quite high. In particular, there is a portion of the matched events for which the recorded deathtoll is exactly the same (276 events i.e.&nbsp;52.67% of the paired events) or of the same order of magnitude (361 events i.e.&nbsp;68.89% of the paired events) which suggests not only that the pairing of events is mainly correct, despite the difficulty of joining completely independently designed datasets, but also that the WD dataset is not entirely about the events with highest deathtoll values.</p>

The 25% shortest articles represent 1&lt;k&lt;=4 segments while the 25% longest represent 26&lt;k&lt;860 segments. The proportion of segments falling into each category is calculated and the distribution of these proportions is displayed through boxplots for each article length category. The plus signs correspond to the median proportions of topics throughout all articles irrespective of articles’ length. The underlying model is proportion~topic+length_category.

<p><a href="#fig-topic_per_length">Figure&nbsp;7</a> shows that the length of the article is probably a very important factor in the topics addressed (or conversely, the topics addressed determine the length of the article), with shorter articles corresponding to factual statements regarding physical features of the event (weather), and justifying reporting that event based on its consequences (damage), while longer articles might convey more extensive reports on the physical causes (hydrology) and management of the crisis (anticipation, governance, relief).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="curation">Curation</h3>
<p>We want to quantify curation of the articles as reflecting the back-and-forth nature of the Wikipedia pages writing process. An index for curation could be used as a measure of a particular effort having been devoted to the establishment of the current text and could thus be interpreted as a sign of possible controversy or debate in its writing process.</p>

The residuals of these relationship correspond to a relative mean edit length, and curation is calculated as minus the residuals. The articles in language ‘simple’ (for ‘simple English’) being destined to be particularly synthetic, we did not take include them in the model.</em></p>
<p><a href="#fig-curation">Figure&nbsp;8</a> shows that beyond a few edits (here, we consider the threshold is 10), the mean edit length for an article depends on the total number of edits for that same article, in an approximately linear relationship with both variables being log-transformed. The more edits a page has undergone, the lower the mean edit length: there is a tendency towards lower mean edit length as the page ‘matures’, with edits in a more advanced writing stage corresponding to suppressions, corrections, or slight modifications while edits at the beginning of the writing process tend to be more frequently text additions. We consider the difference between actual mean edit length edit and predicted mean edit length (based on number of edits) as a measure of relative edit length (it corresponds to a measure of mean edit length decorrelated from this previously described writing stage effect). We calculate the curation score as corresponding to minus the relative edit length (i.e.&nbsp;high level of curation corresponds to smaller-sized edits). These residuals are normalized to correspond to scores ranging from -1 (rather lowly curated articles) to 1 (very highly curated articles). These curation scores are only available for articles that have undergone at least 10 edits, so that article stubs created mainly from an automatic translation process from another Wikipedia page are not included in the analysis of curation effects.</p>
<p>We expect curation to be linked to the characteristics of the articles and the events they describe. We hypothesize in particular that curation will be higher for articles that are longer (editing efforts focused on longer articles), written in a language local to the event and that are about events with a high deathtoll (more public scrutiny). We also consider other explanatory variables such as time (as there can be varying standards for Wikipedia pages redaction), HDI (as a proxy to the number of internet users), affected country’s population and population density (as (as more public scrutiny and more people potentially physically affected by the flood could influence the curation process).</p>

<p><a href="#fig-curation_causes">Figure&nbsp;9</a> .a shows that the level of curation of an article is primarily linked to other characteristics of the page, in particular the length of the article, and the article being written in an language local to the event. It is also linked to characteristics of the event, mainly year, HDI, density and deathtoll, and less importantly so to total population of the country where the event occurred. <a href="#fig-curation_causes">Figure&nbsp;9</a> .b shows that curation is positively correlated to articles length for articles below a certain size and then negatively for longer ones, possibly indicating that curation effort is focused on articles beyond a certain size (1000 to 10000 signs) but tend to be lower for the largest articles. Curation depends largely on the events’ year of occurrence. Curation tend to be lower for events before 2000, probably due to the difficulty of providing sources (as urls mainly) for all statements, and increases rapidly after 2000, possibly due to the combination of an increase of accessible numerical sources and more enforcement of editing standards. Contrary to our expectation, curation is lower in languages local to the event. This could be due to a larger proportion of edits being done by local people motivated by a different set of goals compared to frequent Wikipedia contributors (e.g., aiming to add vernacular content rather than improving pre-existing content). HDI is the next most important explanatory variable, with higher levels corresponding to less curation, as we surmised, although there is quite a high variation of curation for the highest HDIs, possibly due to these representing few languages and thus being affected by Wikipedia language editions with varying standards. As expected, articles are all the more curated that the event’s deathtoll is important, which reflects the fact that the level of scrutiny of Wikipedia editors on pages is correlated to the actual event’s social impact. The density of the country where the event occurred is also positively correlated to the level of curation, while total population is negatively correlated. This might seem slightly contradictory with the fact that curation is lower for local events in the sense that editors being potentially directly affected by the event does not seem to favor curation. Hence this could actually reflect the fact that editors living in densely populated areas are more likely to be frequent Wikipedia contributors and thus more likely to be familiar with Wikipedia’s editing standards.</p>
<p>We expect that the level of curation of an article will be correlated to the topics addressed in the article. We hypothesize that higher-quality articles will correspond to a higher level of curation and address topics which necessitate a deeper level of analysis (such as anticipation, governance, and hydrology) in higher proportions.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-curation_topics">Figure&nbsp;10</a> shows that, contrary to our hypothesis, articles with high levels of curation tend to address topics such as relief, hydrology and governance in lower proportions. This hints at Wikipedia’s curation process actually tending to lower the proportion in which these topics appear (for instance through the suppression of unchecked or debatable statements).</p>

<section id="number-of-views" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="number-of-views">Number of views</h3>
<p>We now consider only events which occurred after July 2015 (the date from which we have access to the number of views of Wikipedia pages), in order to be able to quantify the number of views of various articles at the same stage in time (i.e.&nbsp;from the moment the event occurred).</p>
<p>For each Wikipedia article, we consider the total number of views during the first three months following the creation of the page (which, for the events that have occurred after July 2015, generally corresponds to the first three months following the occurrence of the event). We refer to it hereafter as “short-term number of views”.</p>
<p>We expect the short-term number of views of an article to be dependent of some of the articles’ characteristics such as the article’s being written in a language local to the event, article’s length, and curation, although length and curation being measure on the latest state of development of articles rather than their state during their first three months of existence, they are probably to be interpreted more as consequences than causes. We expect that the number of views will be positively correlated to the level of curation of the article, as articles attracting more views are more likely to attract more scrutiny from editors. We expect the short-term number of views of pages to be higher in the local language, due to Wikipedia being used as an information source regarding the crisis unfolding and management. We also expect the number of views to reflect some characteristics of the events. For instance, we also expect the number of views to be higher for events with a higher deathtoll, and/or events occurring in areas where the density of population is particularly high, as these events are more likely to be of interest to a larger audience.</p>

The subsequent graphics show the partial effect of the descriptors on response.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-views">Figure&nbsp;11</a> .a shows that the short-term number of views of an article is most importantly correlated to curation, though not in the way we expected since highest number of views correspond to low levels of curation. As short-term number of views is also positively linked to article length, this could be interpreted as a sign that quantity of content (rather than quality) is the factor behind the number of views, especially shortly after a crisis, and that curation effort is not particularly focused on the articles generating the most views. The short-term number of views is also, as we expected, positively correlated to the events’ deathtolls. The link to HDI is a bit more difficult to interpret with lowest and highest HDIs corresponding to the most views (independently of e.g.&nbsp;population density or deathtoll). We suspect the high number of views for lowest HDI could be due to e.g.&nbsp;Non-Governmental Organizations channelling foreign and digital-oriented attention to flood events in very vulnerable areas. The short-term number of views tends to increase over the years, and is higher for articles written in a local language, which was to be expected. The effect of population density is difficult to interpret, while total population is positively correlated to the short-term number of view, hinting at the sheer volume of viewers being linked to the size of national public audience.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>This study demonstrates the possibility to list and collect information on flood events on a large temporal and spatial scale through Wikidata, and Wikipedia. Although these data exhibit some heterogeneity <span class="citation" data-cites="lorini_uneven_2020 ruprechter_poor_2023">(<a href="#ref-lorini_uneven_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lorini et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-ruprechter_poor_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Ruprechter, Burghardt, and Helic 2023</a>)</span> due to economic and digital inequities, being able to rely on a preexistent, rich global dataset spanning a large time period is still a priceless asset in studying floods, and could be a first step to better-quality curated datasets. Besides, large-scale institutional data sources themselves are not immune to spatial heterogeneities due to scarcity of research activity in some areas, linguistic barriers, varying degrees of public investment in disaster management, or other sources of environmental, political and social inequities. The overcoming of all these difficulties require an ongoing specialist effort which might not always be guaranteed or easy to sustain.</p>
<p>Linked Open Data such as Wikidata hold great interest for the study of natural or social events due to their inherent ability to offer contextual information to documented items. Linking semantically events when they are documented in fundamentally different datasets (such as DFO and Wikidata) might remain very difficult. Nevertheless, the interconnected nature of Wikidata’s model (as a knowledge graph) as well as their link to other data silos in the Linked Open Data framework allow users to access additional information or related resources linked to a particular event. In particular, the present study demonstrates the strength of such a data source to provide context on a global scale (social context, in particular) through the integration of Wikipedia discourse elements.</p>
<p>In the present study we focused on the extrinsic reasons why entries about floods existed in Wikidata and Wikipedia, discussing it as indicators of the events’ social significance. These platforms also provide guidance of their own as to which items are notable enough to warrant the existence of, primarily, Wikipedia pages <span class="citation" data-cites="wikipedia_notability_2024">(<a href="#ref-wikipedia_notability_2024" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wikipedia_notability_2024?</strong></a>)</span> and subsequently Wikidata pages (as the first condition to the existence of an item for Wikidata is that it should have a link to another Wikimedia-related project e.g.&nbsp;Wikipedia). The criteria for the existence of a page in Wikipedia might differ across language editions but share the same general principles: a subject typically needs to have received significant coverage from reliable, independent sources to be considered notable, information must be verifiable through reliable, independent, and trustworthy sources, and articles must be written from a neutral perspective, presenting all significant views fairly and without bias. The existence of a page in Wikipedia and Wikidata is thus a strong indicator of the event’s notability, but it might be a bit restrictive compared to other lists of events that do not need to comply with as many criteria. Incidentally, Wikipedia itself does in fact offer pages that list items in certain categories, and in particular lists of floods <span class="citation" data-cites="wikipedia_listfloods_2024">(<a href="#ref-wikipedia_listfloods_2024" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wikipedia_listfloods_2024?</strong></a> e.g.)</span>, which might be a good source of information for events that are not as well documented.</p>
<p>This study hints at Wikipedia articles being generally less opinionated than one might think. Wikipedia’s content is indeed based on verifiable sources and strives to present information in a neutral and unbiased manner. While individual contributors may have their own perspectives, Wikipedia’s community guidelines emphasize the importance of maintaining a neutral point of view in articles. Editors are encouraged to cite reliable sources and provide balanced coverage of topics to ensure accuracy and verified, factual content. Here, the possibly controversial topics in the narration of floods (governance, relief, hydrology) are finally less represented in the articles with high levels of curation. This means that a study with a particular interest in debates or controversies would need to rely either on sources of information outside Wikipedia or more specifically on the discussion pages of or revisions history of Wikipedia articles (rather than final article’s content).</p>
<p>The difficulty we faced with the spatial information available in Wikidata regarding floods demonstrates it is not, as such and on its own, a really convenient and rich data source for spatial analysis, which is not entirely surprising as it is not primarily designed for this purpose. This limitation could be overcome by the use of other data sources, such as OpenStreetMap, which is more spatially oriented as a community-driven mapping initiative, and akin in principles to Wikipedia. However, although OpenStreetMap would be a suitable source of spatial data for Wikidata items corresponding to physical objects, it does not deal directly documents events: OpenStreetMap disaster-related projects such as the ones of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team rather focus on making sure that places and people are well mapped throughout the world to help provide relief or anticipate future crises <span class="citation" data-cites="specht_codification_2022">(<a href="#ref-specht_codification_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Specht 2022</a>)</span>. Whatever the database’s structure though, providing spatial information regarding an event (such as a flood) is actually not a trivial task, as it requires the definition (through time) of the event’s spatial extent, location(s), and/or impact area(s). Actually, using Wikipedia pages as a source of information on floods could be a good way to overcome this limitation, as the articles often provide a detailed textual description of the event’s impact area(s) and location(s). Nevertheless, extracting a map from each of the pages and inferring a standardized location from it would probably have arisen many methodological but also semantic questions similar to those surrounding narrative maps <span class="citation" data-cites="caquard_cartography_2013">(<a href="#ref-caquard_cartography_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Caquard 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This study demonstrates that Wikidata and Wikipedia can be used as a source of valuable information on flood events. In particular, the importance and stakes associated to floods can be inferred both from direct (Wikidata) and indirect (Wikipedia) metrics. It could support these data being used to study other kinds of events or even topics, as it demonstrates in particular their ability to provide (con)textual information on these on a wide or even global scale, despite some need for adjustement in the analysis due to possible problems of representativity or precision.</p>
