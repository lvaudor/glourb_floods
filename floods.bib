	abstract = {Abstract 
          Flooding affects more people than any other environmental hazard and hinders sustainable development1–3. Investing in flood adaptation can reduce loss of life and livelihoods 4,5. However, where and how floods occur, and who is exposed, is changing due to rapid urbanization 6, new flood mitigation infrastructure 7,8, and increasing human settlements in floodplains9. Previous studies estimating population exposed to floods are limited by lack of observational data, relying instead on global models with high uncertainty4,10–14. Here we use nearly two decades of daily satellite imagery at 250 meter resolution (MODIS) to develop new estimates of flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000-2018, estimating 2.23 million km2 of flooded area and 290 million people directly affected. We find the at least 86 million people newly settled in a location where satellites observed inundation in the past 20 years. This represents a 20\% increase in the proportion of population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates10. Near-future climate change projections (2030), indicate the proportion of population exposed to floods will continue to expand. Our findings can aid prioritization of global flood adaptation investment and inform adaptation strategies, from insurance to managed retreat, at local scales15–17. As satellite coverage and resolution increase, we anticipate observation of flood events to aid understanding where floods change and how to adapt.  This flood event database will contribute to improved accuracy of global and local flood models, vulnerability assessments, efficacy of adaptation intervention, and understanding interactions of land change, climate, and floods.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are on the rise, and their global impacts on ecosystems, economies and human health are a major challenge. Invasion science is critical to mitigate invader impacts, yet due to the strong increase of data and information in this area, it has become difficult to acquire and maintain an overview of the field. As a result, existing evidence is often not found, knowledge is too rarely transferred to practice, and research is sometimes conducted in pursuit of dead ends. We propose to address these challenges by developing an interactive atlas of invasion science that can be extended to other disciplines in the future. This online portal, which we aim to create in the course of the project described here, will be an evolving knowledge resource and open for anyone to use, including researchers, citizen scientists, practitioners and policy makers. Users will be able to zoom into the major research questions and hypotheses of invasion science, which are connected to the relevant studies published in the field and, if available, the underlying raw data. The portal will apply cutting-edge visualization techniques, artificial intelligence and novel methods for knowledge synthesis.},

This limitation could be alleviated by leveraging information contained in images of the event posted on social media platforms, so-called “Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)”. To save the analyst from manual inspection of all images posted online, we propose to use content-based image retrieval with the possibility of relevance feedback for retrieving only relevant images of the event. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a new dataset of 3,710 flood images, annotated by domain experts regarding their relevance with respect to three tasks (determining the flooded area, inundation depth, water pollution). We compare several image features and relevance feedback methods on that dataset, mixed with 97,085 distractor images, and are able to improve the precision among the top 100 results from 55\% to 87\% after 5 rounds of feedback.},

Wikipedia, a collaboratively-produced encyclopedia, includes in-depth information about many natural and human-made disasters, and its editors are particularly good at adding information in real-time as a crisis unfolds. In this study, we focus on the English version of Wikipedia, that is by far the most comprehensive version of this encyclopedia. Wikipedia tends to have good coverage of disasters, particularly those having a large number of fatalities. However, we also show that a tendency to cover events in wealthy countries and not cover events in poorer ones permeates Wikipedia as a source for disaster-related information. By performing careful automatic content analysis at a large scale, we show how the coverage of floods in Wikipedia is skewed towards rich, English-speaking countries, in particular the US and Canada. We also note how coverage of floods in countries with the lowest income, as well as countries in South America, is substantially lower than the coverage of floods in middle-income countries. These results have implications for systems using Wikipedia or similar collaborative media platforms as an information source for detecting emergencies or for gathering valuable information for disaster response.},

Disaster data depend on the domain by disaster type and include heterogeneous data and lack interoperability. In particular, in the case of open data related to disasters, there are several issues, where the source and format of data are different because various data are collected by different organizations. Moreover, the vocabularies used for each domain are inconsistent. This study proposes a knowledge graph to resolve the heterogeneity among various disaster data and provide interoperability among domains. Among disaster domains, we describe the knowledge graph for flooding disasters using Korean open datasets and cross-domain knowledge graphs. Furthermore, the proposed knowledge graph is used to assist, solve, and manage disaster problems.},

            The immediacy of locational information requirements and importance of data currency for natural disaster events highlights the value of volunteered geographic information (VGI) in all stages of disaster management, including prevention, preparation, response, and recovery. The practice of private citizens generating online geospatial data presents new opportunities for the creation and dissemination of disaster‐related geographic data from a dense network of intelligent observers. VGI technologies enable rapid sharing of diverse geographic information for disaster management at a fraction of the resource costs associated with traditional data collection and dissemination, but they also present new challenges. These include a lack of data quality assurance and issues surrounding data management, liability, security, and the digital divide. There is a growing need for researchers to explore and understand the implications of these data and data practices for disaster management. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge in this emerging field and present recommendations for future research. Significantly, we note further research is warranted in the pre‐event phases of disaster management, where VGI may present an opportunity to connect and engage individuals in disaster preparation and strengthen community resilience to potential disaster events. Our investigation of VGI for disaster management provides broader insight into key challenges and impacts of VGI on geospatial data practices and the wider field of geographical science.},

Moreover, for many people around the world, it also serves as an essential news source for major events such as elections or disasters. Although Wikipedia covers many such events, some events are underrepresented and lack attention, despite their newsworthiness predicted from news value theory. In this paper, we analyze 17 490 event articles in four Wikipedia language editions and examine how the economic status and geographic region of the event location affects the attention and coverage it receives. We find that major Wikipedia language editions have a skewed focus, with more attention given to events in the world’s more economically developed countries and less attention to events in less affluent regions. However, other factors, such as the number of deaths in a disaster, are also associated with the attention an event receives. Overall, this work provides a nuanced understanding of attention and coverage on Wikipedia through event articles and adds new empirical analysis to news value theory.},
