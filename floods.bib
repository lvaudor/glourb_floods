	abstract = {Abstract 
          Flooding affects more people than any other environmental hazard and hinders sustainable development1–3. Investing in flood adaptation can reduce loss of life and livelihoods 4,5. However, where and how floods occur, and who is exposed, is changing due to rapid urbanization 6, new flood mitigation infrastructure 7,8, and increasing human settlements in floodplains9. Previous studies estimating population exposed to floods are limited by lack of observational data, relying instead on global models with high uncertainty4,10–14. Here we use nearly two decades of daily satellite imagery at 250 meter resolution (MODIS) to develop new estimates of flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000-2018, estimating 2.23 million km2 of flooded area and 290 million people directly affected. We find the at least 86 million people newly settled in a location where satellites observed inundation in the past 20 years. This represents a 20\% increase in the proportion of population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates10. Near-future climate change projections (2030), indicate the proportion of population exposed to floods will continue to expand. Our findings can aid prioritization of global flood adaptation investment and inform adaptation strategies, from insurance to managed retreat, at local scales15–17. As satellite coverage and resolution increase, we anticipate observation of flood events to aid understanding where floods change and how to adapt.  This flood event database will contribute to improved accuracy of global and local flood models, vulnerability assessments, efficacy of adaptation intervention, and understanding interactions of land change, climate, and floods.},

As a result, existing evidence is often not found, knowledge is too rarely transferred to practice, and research is sometimes conducted in pursuit of dead ends. We propose to address these challenges by developing an interactive atlas of invasion science that can be extended to other disciplines in the future. This online portal, which we aim to create in the course of the project described here, will be an evolving knowledge resource and open for anyone to use, including researchers, citizen scientists, practitioners and policy makers. Users will be able to zoom into the major research questions and hypotheses of invasion science, which are connected to the relevant studies published in the field and, if available, the underlying raw data. The portal will apply cutting-edge visualization techniques, artificial intelligence and novel methods for knowledge synthesis.},

This limitation could be alleviated by leveraging information contained in images of the event posted on social media platforms, so-called “Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)”. To save the analyst from manual inspection of all images posted online, we propose to use content-based image retrieval with the possibility of relevance feedback for retrieving only relevant images of the event. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a new dataset of 3,710 flood images, annotated by domain experts regarding their relevance with respect to three tasks (determining the flooded area, inundation depth, water pollution). We compare several image features and relevance feedback methods on that dataset, mixed with 97,085 distractor images, and are able to improve the precision among the top 100 results from 55\% to 87\% after 5 rounds of feedback.},

In this study, we focus on the English version of Wikipedia, that is by far the most comprehensive version of this encyclopedia. Wikipedia tends to have good coverage of disasters, particularly those having a large number of fatalities. However, we also show that a tendency to cover events in wealthy countries and not cover events in poorer ones permeates Wikipedia as a source for disaster-related information. By performing careful automatic content analysis at a large scale, we show how the coverage of floods in Wikipedia is skewed towards rich, English-speaking countries, in particular the US and Canada. We also note how coverage of floods in countries with the lowest income, as well as countries in South America, is substantially lower than the coverage of floods in middle-income countries. These results have implications for systems using Wikipedia or similar collaborative media platforms as an information source for detecting emergencies or for gathering valuable information for disaster response.},

Index of severity of floods={\textgreater} use for comparison with Wikidata

A weak point of examining the overall number of floods above a certain magnitude threshold is that events adjacent to each other in time could be subjectively either grouped, as one event, or counted separately, as two. If treated together, they may constitute a super flood. If treated separately, they may constitute two smaller floods of lower magnitude. Decisions on treating adjacent events should be made as objectively as possible, but even separation of adjacent flood discharge hydrographs can be difficult when analysing streamflow records. Fortunately, the news-based source of much of the Flood Observatory Archive information commonly creates natural boundaries around events: damaging, rare flooding attracts abundant news reports, which follow the event as it increases to maximum severity and extent, and the daily news coverage declines as the flood wave begins to recede. Then two alternatives occur: (a) a new input of water initiates new flooding and media coverage, even while the previous event is still being reported, or (b) media attention drops to zero or very near zero, soon after which a new event is reported. These alternatives provide a useful guide to the heuristic “lump or split” decision. Note also that flooding commonly occurs upstream first and then moves downstream. The event begins at upstream l

            The immediacy of locational information requirements and importance of data currency for natural disaster events highlights the value of volunteered geographic information (VGI) in all stages of disaster management, including prevention, preparation, response, and recovery. The practice of private citizens generating online geospatial data presents new opportunities for the creation and dissemination of disaster‐related geographic data from a dense network of intelligent observers. VGI technologies enable rapid sharing of diverse geographic information for disaster management at a fraction of the resource costs associated with traditional data collection and dissemination, but they also present new challenges. These include a lack of data quality assurance and issues surrounding data management, liability, security, and the digital divide. There is a growing need for researchers to explore and understand the implications of these data and data practices for disaster management. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge in this emerging field and present recommendations for future research. Significantly, we note further research is warranted in the pre‐event phases of disaster management, where VGI may present an opportunity to connect and engage individuals in disaster preparation and strengthen community resilience to potential disaster events. Our investigation of VGI for disaster management provides broader insight into key challenges and impacts of VGI on geospatial data practices and the wider field of geographical science.},

In this paper, we analyze 17 490 event articles in four Wikipedia language editions and examine how the economic status and geographic region of the event location affects the attention and coverage it receives. We find that major Wikipedia language editions have a skewed focus, with more attention given to events in the world’s more economically developed countries and less attention to events in less affluent regions. However, other factors, such as the number of deaths in a disaster, are also associated with the attention an event receives. Overall, this work provides a nuanced understanding of attention and coverage on Wikipedia through event articles and adds new empirical analysis to news value theory.},

Wikipedia’s coverage of breaking news events thus presents a case to test theories about how open collaborations coordinate complex, time-sensitive, and knowledge-intensive work in the absence of central authority, stable membership, clear roles, or reliable information. Using the revision history from Wikipedia articles about over 3,000 breaking news events, we investigate the structure of interactions between editors and articles. Because breaking article collaborations unfold more rapidly and involve more editors than most Wikipedia articles, they potentially regenerate prior forms of organizing. We analyze whether the structures of breaking and nonbreaking article networks are (a) similarly structured over time, (b) exhibit features of organizational regeneration, and (c) have similar collaboration dynamics over time. Breaking and nonbreaking article exhibit similarities in their structural characteristics over the long run, and there is less evidence of organizational regeneration on breaking articles than nonbreaking articles. However, breaking articles emerge into well-connected collaborations more rapidly than nonbreaking articles, suggesting early contributors play a crucial role in supporting these high-tempo collaborations.},

	abstract = {Science and technology studies is famous for questioning conceptual and material boundaries by following controversies that cut across them. However, it has recently been argued that in research involving online platforms (Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), there are also more practical boundaries to negotiate that are created by the variable availability, visibility, and structuring of data. In this paper, I highlight a potential tension between our inclination toward following controversies and “following the medium” and suggest that sometimes following controversies might involve going “against platforms” as well as with them. I will illustrate this dilemma through an analysis of the controversy over the coverage of the Fukushima disaster on English language Wikipedia, which concerns boundaries between expert and lay knowledge but also the social and technical functioning of Wikipedia itself. For this reason, I show that following the controversy might mean making use of less formatted and less obvious data than Wikipedia normally provides. While this is not an argument against the use of automated digital research tools such as scrapers, I suggest that both quantitative and qualitative researchers need to be more willing to tweak their approaches based on the specificities of the case.},

A challenging step of topic modeling is determining the number of topics to extract. This tutorial describes tools researchers can use to identify the number and labels of topics in topic modeling. First, we outline the procedure for narrowing down a large range of models to a select number of candidate models. This procedure involves comparing the large set on fit metrics, including exclusivity, residuals, variational lower bound, and semantic coherence. Next, we describe the comparison of a small number of models using project goals as a guide and information about topic representative and solution congruence.

	abstract = {Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places. These geographies of information about places matter because they shape how we are able to find and understand different parts of the world. Places invisible or discounted in representations are invisible in practice to many people. In other words, geographic augmentations are much more than just representations of places: they are part of the place itself; they shape it rather than simply reflect it. This fusing of the spatial and informational augmentations that are immutable means that annotations of place emerge as sites of political contestation: with different groups of people trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations. This paper therefore explores how information geographies have their own geographic distributions: geographies of access, of participation, and of representation. The paper offers a deliberately broad survey of a range of key platforms that mediate, host, and deliver different types of geographic information. It does so using a combination of existing statistics and bespoke data not previously mapped or analysed. Through this effort, the paper demonstrates that in addition to the geographies of uneven access to contemporary modes of communication, uneven geographies of participation and representation are also evident and in some cases are being amplified rather than alleviated. In other words, the paper comprehensively shows one important facet of contemporary information geographies: that geographic information itself is characterised by a host of uneven geographies. The paper concludes that there are few signs that global informational peripheries are achieving comparable levels of participation or representation with traditional information cores, despite the hopes that the fast‐paced spread of the internet to three billion people might change this pattern.

              Online representations of places are becoming pivotal in informing our understanding of urban life. Content production on online platforms is grounded in the geography of their users and their digital infrastructure. These constraints shape
              place representation
              , that is, the amount, quality, and type of digital information available in a geographic area. In this article we study the place representation of user‐generated content (UGC) in Los Angeles County, relating the spatial distribution of the data to its geo‐demographic context. Adopting a comparative and multi‐platform approach, this quantitative analysis investigates the spatial relationship between four diverse UGC datasets and their context at the census tract level (about 685,000 geo‐located tweets, 9,700 Wikipedia pages, 4 million OpenStreetMap objects, and 180,000 Foursquare venues). The context includes the ethnicity, age, income, education, and deprivation of residents, as well as public infrastructure. An exploratory spatial analysis and regression‐based models indicate that the four UGC platforms possess distinct geographies of place representation. To a moderate extent, the presence of Twitter, OpenStreetMap, and Foursquare data is influenced by population density, ethnicity, education, and income. However, each platform responds to different socio‐economic factors and clusters emerge in disparate hotspots. Unexpectedly, Twitter data tend to be located in denser, more deprived areas, and the geography of Wikipedia appears peculiar and harder to explain. These trends are compared with previous findings for the area of Greater London.},

Our study aims to provide a general overview of the research performed on Wikidata through a systematic mapping study in order to identify the current topical coverage of existing research as well as the white spots which need further investigation. In this study, 67 peer-reviewed research from journals and conference proceedings were selected, and classified into meaningful categories. We describe this data set descriptively by showing the publication frequency, the publication venue and the origin of the authors and reveal current research focuses. These especially include aspects concerning data quality, including questions related to language coverage and data integrity. These results indicate a number of future research directions, such as, multilingualism and overcoming language gaps, the impact of plurality on the quality of Wikidata's data, Wikidata's potential in various disciplines, and usability of user interface.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper presents the results of an exploratory quantitative analysis of gendered contributions to the online mapping project OpenStreetMap (OSM), in which previous research has identified a strong male participation bias. On these grounds, theories of representation in volunteered geographic information (VGI) have argued that this kind of crowdsourced data fails to embody the geospatial interests of the wider community. The observed effects of the bias however, remain conspicuously absent from discourses of VGI and gender, which proceed with little sense of impact. This study addresses this void by analysing OSM contributions by gender and thus identifies differences in men’s and women’s mapping practices. An online survey uniquely captured the OSM IDs as well as the declared gender of 293 OSM users. Statistics relating to users’ editing and tagging behaviours openly accessible via the ‘how did you contribute to OSM’ wiki page were subsequently analysed. The results reveal that volumes of overall activity as well editing and tagging actions in OSM remain significantly dominated by men. They also indicate subtle but impactful differences in men’s and women’s preferences for modifying and creating data, as well as the tagging categories to which they contribute. Discourses of gender and ICT, gender relations in online VGI environments and competing motivational factors are implicated in these observations. As well as updating estimates of the gender participation bias in OSM, this paper aims to inform and stimulate subsequent discourses of gender and representation towards a new rationale for widening participation in VGI.},

            In the past 10 years, the collaborative maps of OpenStreetMap (OSM) have been used to support humanitarian efforts around the world as well as to fill important data gaps for implementing major development frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of humanitarian mapping within the OSM community, seeking to understand the spatial and temporal footprint of these large-scale mapping efforts. The spatio-temporal statistical analysis of OSM’s full history since 2008 showed that humanitarian mapping efforts added 60.5 million buildings and 4.5 million roads to the map. Overall, mapping in OSM was strongly biased towards regions with very high Human Development Index. However, humanitarian mapping efforts had a different footprint, predominantly focused on regions with medium and low human development. Despite these efforts, regions with low and medium human development only accounted for 28\% of the buildings and 16\% of the roads mapped in OSM although they were home to 46\% of the global population. Our results highlight the formidable impact of humanitarian mapping efforts such as post-disaster mapping campaigns to improve the spatial coverage of existing open geographic data and maps, but they also reveal the need to address the remaining stark data inequalities, which vary significantly across countries. We conclude with three recommendations directed at the humanitarian mapping community: (1) Improve methods to monitor mapping activity and identify where mapping is needed. (2) Rethink the design of projects which include humanitarian data generation to avoid non-sustainable outcomes. (3) Remove structural barriers to empower local communities and develop capacity.},

            The recent growth of online big data offers opportunities for rapid and inexpensive measurement of public interest. Conservation culturomics is an emerging research area that uses online data to study human–nature relationships for conservation. Methods for conservation culturomics, though promising, are still being developed and refined. We considered the potential of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, as a resource for conservation culturomics and outlined methods for using Wikipedia data in conservation. Wikipedia's large size, widespread use, underlying data structure, and open access to both its content and usage analytics make it well suited to conservation culturomics research. Limitations of Wikipedia data include the lack of location information associated with some metadata and limited information on the motivations of many users. Seven methodological steps to consider when using Wikipedia data in conservation include metadata selection, temporality, taxonomy, language representation, Wikipedia geography, physical and biological geography, and comparative metrics. Each of these methodological decisions can affect measures of online interest. As a case study, we explored these themes by analyzing 757 million Wikipedia page views associated with the Wikipedia pages for 10,099 species of birds across 251 Wikipedia language editions. We found that Wikipedia data have the potential to generate insight for conservation and are particularly useful for quantifying patterns of public interest at large scales.

              La Wikipedia como Instrumento de Medición del Interés Público por la Biodiversidad y la Conservación
              
                Resumen
                El crecimiento reciente de los datos masivos en línea ofrece oportunidades para la medición rápida y asequible del interés público. La culturomia de la conservación es un área emergente de investigación que utiliza la información en línea para estudiar las relaciones entre el humano y la naturaleza y usarlas para la conservación. Los métodos de conservación basados en culturomia, aunque prometedores, todavía están siendo desarrollados y refinados. Consideramos el potencial de Wikipedia, la enciclopedia en línea, como recurso para la culturomia de la conservación y los métodos para usar sus datos en la conservación. El gran tamaño de Wikipedia, su uso extenso, estructura subyacente de datos y acceso abierto tanto a su contenido como a sus análisis de uso hacen que sea muy adecuada para usarse en la investigación de culturomia de la conservación. Las limitantes de usar la información de Wikipedia incluyen la falta de ubicación de la información asociada con algunos metadatos y la información limitada sobre los motivos de muchos usuarios. Hay siete pasos metodológicos a considerar cuando se usa la información de Wikipedia para la conservación: la selección de metadatos, temporalidad, taxonomía, representación del idioma, geografía de la Wikipedia, geografía física y biológica y medidas comparativas. Cada una de estas decisiones metodológicas puede afectar a las medidas del interés en línea. Como estudio de caso, exploramos estos temas analizando 757 millones de vistas de páginas en Wikipedia para las páginas sobre 10, 099 especies de aves a través de 251 ediciones de Wikipedia en idiomas diferentes. Encontramos que la información de Wikipedia fue particularmente útil para cuantificar los patrones de interés público a grandes escalas y tiene el potencial para generar conocimiento para la conservación.

            摘要
            
              在线大数据的增长为快速简便地衡量公众兴趣提供了机会。保护文化组学是一个新兴的研究领域, 利用在线数据来研究保护中人与自然之间的关系。保护文化组学的方法虽然很有前景, 但仍在开发和完善当中。本研究探索了将在线百科全书——维基百科用作保护文化组学资源的潜力以及将维基百科数据用于保护的方法。维基百科庞大的规模、广泛的应用、底层数据结构, 以及对其内容和使用分析的开放访问, 使其非常适合于保护文化组学研究。而维基百科数据的局限性包括缺少某些元数据的位置信息, 以及许多用户内在动机的信息有限。在使用维基百科数据进行保护时需要考虑七个方法步骤, 包括元数据选择、时间性、生物分类、语言代表性、维基百科地理、物理和生物地理, 以及比较指标。对这些方法的选择会影响对在线兴趣的衡量。作为案例研究, 我们还分析了维基百科251种语言版本中10,099种鸟类7.57亿次的浏览情况来探究这些主题。我们发现, 维基百科的数据对于大尺度量化公众兴趣格局有很大帮助, 并且有产生保护见解的潜力。

            Wikidata has been widely used in Digital Humanities (DH) projects. However, a focused discussion regarding the current status, potential, and challenges of its application in the field is still lacking. A systematic review was conducted to identify and evaluate how DH projects perceive and utilize Wikidata, as well as its potential and challenges as demonstrated through use. This research concludes that: (1) Wikidata is understood in the DH projects as a content provider, a platform, and a technology stack; (2) it is commonly implemented for annotation and enrichment, metadata curation, knowledge modelling, and Named Entity Recognition (NER); (3) Most projects tend to consume data from Wikidata, whereas there is more potential to utilize it as a platform and a technology stack to publish data on Wikidata or to create an ecosystem of data exchange; and (4) Projects face two types of challenges: technical issues in the implementations and concerns with Wikidata’s data quality. In the discussion, this article contributes to addressing three issues related to coping with the challenges in the specific context of the DH field based on the research findings: the relevance and authority of other available domain sources; domain communities and their practices; and workflow design that coordinates technical and labour resources from projects and Wikidata.},

	abstract = {Abstract. There is an increasing need for strategic global assessments of flood risks in current and future conditions. In this paper, we propose a framework for global flood risk assessment for river floods, which can be applied in current conditions, as well as in future conditions due to climate and socio-economic changes. The framework's goal is to establish flood hazard and impact estimates at a high enough resolution to allow for their combination into a risk estimate, which can be used for strategic global flood risk assessments. The framework estimates hazard at a resolution of {\textasciitilde} 1 km2 using global forcing datasets of the current (or in scenario mode, future) climate, a global hydrological model, a global flood-routing model, and more importantly, an inundation downscaling routine. The second component of the framework combines hazard with flood impact models at the same resolution (e.g. damage, affected GDP, and affected population) to establish indicators for flood risk (e.g. annual expected damage, affected GDP, and affected population). The framework has been applied using the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB, which includes an optional global flood routing model DynRout, combined with scenarios from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE). We performed downscaling of the hazard probability distributions to 1 km2 resolution with a new downscaling algorithm, applied on Bangladesh as a first case study application area. We demonstrate the risk assessment approach in Bangladesh based on GDP per capita data, population, and land use maps for 2010 and 2050. Validation of the hazard estimates has been performed using the Dartmouth Flood Observatory database. This was done by comparing a high return period flood with the maximum observed extent, as well as by comparing a time series of a single event with Dartmouth imagery of the event. Validation of modelled damage estimates was performed using observed damage estimates from the EM-DAT database and World Bank sources. We discuss and show sensitivities of the estimated risks with regard to the use of different climate input sets, decisions made in the downscaling algorithm, and different approaches to establish impact models.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Frequency and duration of floods are analyzed using the global flood database of the Dartmouth Flood
Observatory (DFO) to explore evidence
of trends during 1985–2015 at global and latitudinal scales. Three classes
of flood duration (i.e., short: 1–7, moderate: 8–20, and long: 21 days and
above) are also considered for this analysis. The nonparametric Mann–Kendall
trend analysis is used to evaluate three hypotheses addressing potential
monotonic trends in the frequency of flood, moments of duration, and
frequency of specific flood duration types. We also evaluated
if trends could be related to large-scale atmospheric teleconnections using a
generalized linear model framework. Results show that flood frequency and
the tails of the flood duration (long duration) have increased at both the
global and the latitudinal scales. In the tropics, floods have increased
4-fold since the 2000s. This increase is 2.5-fold in the north
midlatitudes. However, much of the trend in frequency and duration of the
floods can be placed within the long-term climate variability context since
the
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Pacific
Decadal Oscillation were the main atmospheric teleconnections explaining this
trend. There is no monotonic trend in the frequency of short-duration floods
across all the global and latitudinal scales. There is a significant
increasing trend in the annual median of flood durations globally and each
latitudinal belt, and this trend is not related to these teleconnections.
While the DFO data come with a certain level of epistemic uncertainty due to
imprecision in the estimation of floods, overall, the analysis provides
insights for understanding the frequency and persistence in hydrologic
extremes and how they relate to changes in the climate, organization of
global and local dynamical systems, and country-scale socioeconomic factors.},

              At the same time, an unprecedented amount of scientific articles on COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic have been published online. Wikipedia’s content is based on reliable sources, such as scientific literature. Given its public function, it is crucial for Wikipedia to rely on representative and reliable scientific results, especially in a time of crisis. We assess the coverage of COVID-19-related research in Wikipedia via citations to a corpus of over 160,000 articles. We find that Wikipedia editors are integrating new research at a fast pace, and have cited close to 2\% of the COVID-19 literature under consideration. While doing so, they are able to provide a representative coverage of COVID-19-related research. We show that all the main topics discussed in this literature are proportionally represented from Wikipedia, after accounting for article-level effects. We further use regression analyses to model citations from Wikipedia and show that Wikipedia editors on average rely on literature that is highly cited, widely shared on social media, and peer-reviewed.},

              Financial crises result from a catastrophic combination of actions. Vast stock market datasets offer us a window into some of the actions that have led to these crises. Here, we investigate whether data generated through Internet usage contain traces of attempts to gather information before trading decisions were taken. We present evidence in line with the intriguing suggestion that data on changes in how often financially related

We advance a threefold categorization of the intensifying relationship between geography and the digital, documenting geographies produced through, produced by, and of the digital. Instead of promoting a single theoretical framework for making sense of the digital or proclaiming the advent of a separate field of ‘digital geography’, we conclude by suggesting conceptual, methodological and empirical questions and possible paths forward for the ‘digital turn’ across geography’s many sub-disciplines.},

Following a brief historical contextualization of these relationships, this report explores their current state in the Geoweb era. Using the distinction between story maps and grid maps as an analytical framework, I review emerging issues around the extensive use of technologies and online mapping services (i.e. Google maps) to convey stories and to produce new ones. Drawing on literature in film studies, literary studies, visual arts, computer science and communication, I also emphasize the emergence of new forms of spatial expressions interested in providing different perspectives about places and about stories associated to places. In sum, I argue that mapping both vernacular knowledge and fiction is central to understanding places in depth.},

	abstract = {The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, affectionately known as HOT, worked on mapping the city of Dar es Salaam between 2014 and 2020. The efforts of HOT were designed to not only build a map of the city that would ‘put people on the map’, but to also use these maps to aid in development and humanitarian interventions through one of Africa’s fastest growing cities, all while using participatory mapping practices. This thesis examines the extent to which HOT has been able to achieve the creation of a new map of Dar es Salaam, the influence this map had on development projects, and the degree to which the map was built using participatory methods. The research undertook a deep analysis of map completion and accuracy and used interviews to explore the interplay between technology and micro/macro politics around the mapping of Dar es Salaam. Findings suggest that HOT is still underdeveloped as an organization and lacks the maturity to create true participatory models of working. That many of their practices were exclusionary to the local population and that weak management structures and procedures allowed colonial and ‘outsider’ saviour complexes to grow within the organisation. The work concludes by noting that HOT has begun to change many of its practices since 2020 where this research ends.},
